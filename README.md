A network traffic analyzer captures, monitors, and analyzes data packets in real-time or from stored captures. It provides insights into network performance, security threats, and aids in troubleshooting, optimizing resources, and maintaining network integrity within a computer network.
This Python script uses the Scapy library to watch for potential security issues in network traffic. It captures packets, checks them for suspicious activity, and alerts if it finds anything concerning. The script has two main functions:

analyze_packet(packet): This function looks at each packet captured and can be customized to check for specific threats. For now, it prints out details about each packet and raises an alert if it finds an ICMP packet.

monitor_traffic(interface): This function starts capturing packets on the chosen network interface (by default, it's "eth0"). It uses Scapy's sniff function to capture packets and calls the analyze_packet function for each one.

To use this script:

Step 1: Install Scapy if you haven't already (using 'pip install scapy').

Step 2: Save the script to a Python file (like 'network_traffic_analyzer.py').

Step 3: Run the script with appropriate permissions (e.g., 'sudo python3 network_monitor.py').

Remember to use this script responsibly and ethically, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical considerations when scanning systems and applications for vulnerabilities."
